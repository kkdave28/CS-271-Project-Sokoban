Course project for CS-271 Intro to AI. Co contributers are Sriram Rao, Kush Dave and Yinan Zhou. 

To run the project, do `python3 main.py path_to_input_file 60` in command line

In the above command:
  - path_to_input_file is the path to an input file to be solved
  - 60 is the time to run the program in minutes, 60 means run for 60 minutes. Note that 60 is the time allowed for the learning part of the algorithm. Generating the final result may take extra time so 60 is not a strict time limit.
